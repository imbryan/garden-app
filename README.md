# GardenApp
An application to help manage your garden.

## About this project
Are you a gardener, or maybe even a farmer? In that case, it's time to ditch the pen and paper for the mouse and keyboard. This application will help you keep track of your garden, down to the individual plants - never again will you forget to water your tomatoes!

## Disclaimer
This is my very first open-source project; you may come across novice mistakes! As per the project license, I am not liable for any plant damage.
