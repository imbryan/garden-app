# GardenApp
An application to help manage your garden.

## About this project
Are you a gardener, or maybe even a farmer? In that case, it's time to ditch the pen and paper for the mouse and keyboard. This application will help you keep track of your garden, down to individual plants - never again will you forget to water your tomatoes!

## Disclaimer
This is my very first open-source project; you might come across novice mistakes. As per the project's license, I am not responsible for any possible death of plants.
